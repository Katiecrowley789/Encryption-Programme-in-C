Program description. This code is a simple encryption programme that store inputs,generate random code,
encrypt,decrypt and compare input code with the pre-encrypted code.
The access code is 4523.The user first has the option to enter their own code in four parts
or randomly generate a code.
Next the user can encrypt the code,this algorithm looks like
 -Swap the 1st number with the 3rd number.
- Swap the 2nd number with the 4th number.
- Add 1 to each number.
- If any number has a value equal to 10, change this value to 0. 
Then the user can check if their entered or generated code matchs the pre-encryped code,4523(access_code).
If it is a match then you will be told "Correct",if it is an incorrect match you will be called "Wrong".
Lastly, the final option to close the program offer you a choice to close or return to menu.
